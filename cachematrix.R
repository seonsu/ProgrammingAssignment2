## Assignment: Caching the Inverse of a Matrix
## 1. makeCacheMatrix :
##  This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## 2. cacheSolve:
##  This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
##  If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), 
##  then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.


## This function creates a "matrix" object which can cache its inverse
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  
  ## Initialize s that is the Inverse of x
  s <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    ## the <<- operator which can be used to assign a value to an object in an environment 
    ## that is different from the current environment
    x <<- y
    s <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setsolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
  getsolve <- function() s
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setsolve = setsolve,
       getsolve = getsolve)  
  
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix"
## returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  
  ## x is a special matrix
  s <- x$getsolve()
  
  ##  it checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated
  if(!is.null(s)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(s)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  s <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setsolve(s)
  
  ## Return a matrix which is the inverse of 'x'
  s
  
}
